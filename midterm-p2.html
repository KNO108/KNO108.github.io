		<h1>My Favorite Characters</h1>
   </header>

<ul>
  <li>Bear Mckenna/Thompson(BOATK series)</li>
  <li>Gordo Livingstone(Green Creek series)</li>
  <li>Paul Auster(At First Sight series)</li>
  <li>Otter Thompson(BOATK series)</li>
  <li>Sandy Stewart(At First Sight series)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see my favorite characters list is a little bit biased haha. Green Creek, BOATK, and At First Sight were pretty much my first deep dive series with TJ so a lot of the characters mean a lot to me. I could never rank them though, and this list could be much much longer!</p>


<div class="three">
<h2 class="otter">Bear, Otter, and the Kid</h2>
<p> The BOATK series was my next experience after reading "Wolfsong". I quickly became attached to Bear and Otter's love story, and the situation with the Kid. Bear has taken over raising his little brother after his mom abandoned them, and the found family he has around to support them are all wonderful people. And the Kid/Tyson's book really helped me, as it followed Ty with his anxiety disorder, and I myself have social anxiety. To get to experience the mental illness of this character I loved so much, was very helpful for my own mental state. It helped me realize that I could get help if I wanted it. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12156759-bear-otter-and-the-kid?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=OY50f2CsOm&rank=1" target=" _blank">Goodreads link to "Bear, Otter, and the Kid"</a></p>

<h2 class="helena">At First Sight</h2>
<p>The At First Sight series, is something else. It's some of the hardest I have ever laughed in my life, let alone at a book. I love Paul and Sandy's relationship, they're friendship/brotherhood is so special it made me cry many times. I love Vince, he may be a little bit slow, but my gosh he's one of the sweetest characters you'll ever meet in a book. Paul learning that he can be loved despite his size is an important message, and overall this series is a very accepting one. It has an overweight MC, Drag Queen MC, and a bigender MC. I love this zany bunch of characters, and you can find that wonderful found family unit again. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17194490-tell-me-it-s-real?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nFbQV7uHTY&rank=5" target=" _blank">Goodreads link to "Tell Me It's Real"</a></p>

<h2 class="cerulean">The House in the Cerulean Sea</h2>
<p> "The House in the Cerulean Sea" was TJ's first book by a big five publisher!! He so deserves it, and all of the successes that can come to him. Recently Cerulean even got onto The New York Times Bestseller List!! For 5 weeks! Sorry, I'm very excited haha. Cerulean came out just in time for the Covid-19 pandemic to kick in, and it's a perfect book to help you get through quarantine. The ray of sunshine, and hope, and love that is this book is very importnat, and it has obviously resonated with people if the reviews and sales are any indication! If you want to read a lovely book about an orphanage full of wonderful magical children, this is the book for you!  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45047384-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=LSHWcpZetW&rank=1" target=" _blank">Goodreads link to "The House in the Cerulean Sea"</a></p>
