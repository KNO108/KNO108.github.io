		<h1>TJ Klune's Novels</h1>
   </header>

	
	<p> <a href="http://www.tjklunebooks.com/biography" target="_self">"TJ Klune</a> is a Lambda Literary Award-winning author (Into This River I Drown) and an ex-claims examiner for an insurance company. His novels include  the Green Creek series, The House on the Cerulean Sea and The Exraordinaries. Being queer himself, TJ believes it's important—now more than ever—to have accurate, positive, queer representation in stories."</p>
		<p> TJ Klune is my current favorite author, and the writer of many lovely books. I first began my journey of reading his novels in 2017, with "Wolfsong" and then the "Bear, Otter, and the Kid" series.  </p>
	

<h2>My Favorite Books/Series</h2>
<p class="books"> TJ has about 30 books published and they are primarily in the LGBTQ+ genre of M/M romance. But they're a whole lot more than that! Almost all of his works explore the concept of found family and how you can choose who is most important to you and they can choose you back. You don't have to be related to have a familial relationship with someone. His books will take you on an emotional roller coaster, as well! Never have I laughed so hard or cried so much, as at a TJ Klune book. There's just something special about the words he writes, and I'm happy that he graces us with his brilliance. </p>

<ul>
  <li>The Green Creek Series ("Wolfsong", "Ravensong", "Heartsong", "Brothersong")</li>
  <li>BOATK series ("Bear, Otter, and the Kid", "Who We Are", The Art of Breathing", "The Long and Winding Road")</li>
  <li>The At First Sight series ("Tell Me It's Real", "The Queen and the Homo Jock King", "Until You", "Why We Fight")</li>
  <li>"The Bones Beneath My Skin"</li>
  <li>"The House in the Cerulean Sea"</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="creek">Green Creek</h2>
<p>My first TJ Klune book was "Wolfsong". It's a series about a werewolf pack called the Bennetts and all of the challenges they go through in their lives. The writing style immediately caught my attention. The main character Ox, has such a beautiful way of seeing the world and the book describes things from his point of view. There's something special in this POV and TJ's writing in general that makes the book quite the journey. I've chosen a Raven picture as well because the second book "Ravensong" is my favorite in the series. It follows my favorite character Gordo and continues the plot from the first book, while also exploring Gordo's long time relationship with Mark. "Ravensong" is a very special book to me, and also thanks to a lovely friend I have a personalized signed copy, it's one of my prized possessions.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29233804-wolfsong?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=10spXK2t6X&rank=1" target=" _blank"> Goodreads link to "Wolfsong"</a></p>

<h2 class="bones">The Bones Beneath My Skin</h2>
<p>"The Bones Beneath My Skin" is one of the few standalone books by TJ that I've read. It follows a little girl named Artemis Darth Vader who may or may not be an alien ;) and her adventure; while two characters named Alex and Nate do their best to protect her from many different threats. The tone of this book is like nothing else TJ has written, it's such an interesting book. The tension at all times about Artemis's safety and the growing relationship between Nate and Alex, and Nate and Artemis, while they all become a quasi family unit is just so well told.<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41452130-the-bones-beneath-my-skin?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=NT2hau92ru&rank=1" target=" _blank">Goodreads link to "The Bones Beneath My Skin"</a></p>
